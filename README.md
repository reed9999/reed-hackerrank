This is a place to publish non-trivial answers to fame for my hackerrank challenges, a sort of "hall of fame."

I share the consensus that HackerRank is less valuable to showcase skills than sinking one's teeth
into a real project.
Even so, there are examples here that demonstrate my problem solving process and my growth
in learning some of the algorithm optimization that wasn't included when I learned to code on the 
job (as a QA developer and Web developer).
Here are some highlights:

- **abbr.py**. Still times out on a couple of test cases on the HackerRank.com server but a good experience fine-tuning a deep recursive algorithm.
- **new\_year\_chaos**: A case where I overthought my original solution, saw it time out quite a bit, and realized a streamlined solution works just fine.
- **minimum-absolute-difference-in-array.\* **: The Pragmatic Programming folks advocate learning a new language each year. Raw language learning isn't my priority right now, but there's value to implementing a simple algorithm in several languages (even LOLCODE, ha) to compare and contrast.
- **Anything with .js**: I'm learning JavaScript so implementing Python examples in JS is a good way to develop bilingualism.
